  "titulo": "Luís I Bridge",
  "texto": "The Luís I bridge was designed by Théophile Seyrig, who worked with Gustave Eiffel in the construction of the D. Maria railway bridge. At the time construction was finished, it was the longest bridge of its kind in the world. This was the third bridge built in this place. The first, a boat bridge, collapsed, killing thousands of people, during the french invasions, as a crowd tried to escape the french army. The second one, a suspended bridge, became insufficient for the traffic going from Porto to Gaia and Lisbon. You can still see the pillars that supported the bridge, on the west side of the Luis I bridge. In Portuguese, the name of a king is always preceded by Dom. It is said that that was not included in the name of the bridge because the king, D Luis I, missed the inauguration of the bridge.”.",
